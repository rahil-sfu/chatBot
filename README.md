## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

React relies on Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) for development and package management. Follow these steps to install them:

1. Go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version, which is recommended for most users. This will include both Node.js and npm.

3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions. The installer will guide you through the setup process.

4. To verify the installation, open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window and run the following commands:

   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
You should see the versions of Node.js and npm printed to the console, indicating that they were installed successfully.

## Step 2: Start the Development Server
Now that you're inside your React app's directory, you can start the development server.

Run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm start
```
This will start the development server and open your default web browser, displaying your React app.

By default, the development server will automatically reload the app whenever you make changes to the code. You can access your app at http://localhost:3000.
